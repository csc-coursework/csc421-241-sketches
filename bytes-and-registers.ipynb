    "Computers have mechanisms for memory, computation, and communication. In this section we look at memory. The basic building blocks of memory in the modern computer are the _register_ and the _byte_.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The byte is the basic building block the Random Access Memory (RAM), which is the focus of most dicussions about memory. It is fast, large, and easily accessed. A _bit_ is a storage element that can be one of two states, we will call them 0 or 1. A _byte_ is 8 bits together with each bit having its place in the byte, from the 0-th bit to the 7-th bit. \n",
    "\n",
    "That the byte has 8 bits is so common that I will just define a byte to be 8 bits, but in fact, early computers had diferent lenghts of bytes. For various reasons, 8 turned out the just the right size for the purpose.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bytes are collected into a large, enummerated array called the RAM memory. Each byte in the array is known by its number in this array, called the byte's _address_. That each byte is equally accessible regardless of its address gives rise to the name _random_ access memory. \n",
    "\n",
    "__N.B.:__ This is mostly true. So much depends on the speed of RAM that there are techniques that make memory accesss faster by moving memory electrically closer to the computation devices. A _cache_ contains a copy of the hot data in a fast, local memory, and will write it back to RAM when the data goes cold. This reuses the fast memory on demand. A NUMA machine (Non-uniform memory architecture) will have RAM better associated with some computation devices than others. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are several useful consequences of having integer addresses,\n",
    "\n",
    "- Some data items need to be built from multiple bytes. By using addresses in sequence the address of the item and all its components are easiliy determined.\n",
    "- Some data items are in repeating multiples, and integer arithmetic can be used for these items to offest to the particular item in the group.\n",
    "\n",
    "We note that a byte has 256 possibel different bit combinations. This is often assocated with the integers 0 through 255. \n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "A _register_ is a number $n$ of bits taken together where each bit has its location in the collection, from bit 0 up to bit $n-1$. In this sense it generalizes the byte. However registers are found in the CPU and are addressed differently. Some registers, such as the _Instrution Pointer_ (IP) and the _Stack Pointer_ (SP), are used by the nature of the CPU operation: an instruction fetch uses the IP and a stack push uses the SP. Some registers are named, such as the B and C registers in the early Intel 8085, and some are indexed by an integer like an array.\n",
    "\n",
    "Today, a typical size for a register on a 64 bit machine is 64 bits. Older machine had small registers. The Intel 8085, in the early 1980's, had 16 bit registers. They were quicly enough replaced by such machines as the Intel 8086 with 32 bit registers. In this case, for backwards compatibility, each 32 register also can be identified by the upper and lower halves as 16 bit registers. \n",
    "\n",
    "### <a name=basenotation>Binary and other notations</a>\n",
    "\n",
    "The use of binary was basically practical. The bit state would be based on some physical phenomena. A binary indicator is tolerant of noise by making the overall signal size larger than the possible noise. A threshold value is given, and anything measured value above the threshold is a 1, and any below is a 0. The noise amounts will not matter as long as the noise amplitude keep the intended signal on the proper side of the threshold.\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, the correspondence between the bit pattern and an integer can be made completely natural thorugh the binary representation of the integer value. Recall that a number $n$  can be represented as a collection of zero-one values, $b_i$ by,\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "n = \\sum_i b_i \\, 2^i\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In the case of the byte, the bits are assigned their bit number, giving the $b_i$ that is to appear in this equation. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that a byte is an integer that has exactly 8 bits. Bytes and registers differ from integers in that integers have no fixed maximum size. Bytes and registers have a maximum size and an exact number of bits with leading zeros if necessary. \n",
    "\n",
    "We will follow C language syntax and indicate a binary number by prefixing a 0-1 string with the indicatior `0b`. The number 5 in binary is `0b101`. However thinking about a byte it is can be written as `0b00000101`, accounting for all 8 bits in the byte.\n",
    "\n",
    "Already we see how tedious it is to write numbers in binary, although they suit the hardware just fine. Instead, when trying to visualize an integer written in binary in terms of which bits are 1 and which are 0, the number is better written in base 16, known as _hexidecimal_. It is pretty important for a computer scientist to know hexidecimal, so I hope to give you some exericses to practice this number notation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hexidecimal is base 16, hence there must be 16 \"digits\" for each place, and these are, \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, a, b, c, d, e, f\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "We will fillow C language syntax and indicate a hexidecimal number by prefixing the string of thise hex-its with the indicator `0x`. The number 10 in hexidecimal is `0xa`, However thinking about a byte it is best to write this as `0x0a`, so all 8 bits are accounted for.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We will call _register_ the notion of a byte, but of any length. This is novel language, except that it is consistent with the name _registers_ are is it used in CPU architectures. When data is stored in a CPU it is stored in a CPU register. A 16 bit register (Intel 8085) it can store numbers from `0x0000` to `0xffff` (0 to 65,536).\n"

    "\n",
    "A bit can be represented by any manner in which there can be a distinction between two states. Here we see an early data storage strategy with a paper tape. Each column across the tape was a 5 bit byte, and it locations marked off in fifths of the way from edge to edge. A hole was a 1 and no hole was a 0. The 5 bit byte was supported by an early code called the [Baudot code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baudot_code), invented by Emile Baudot in 1870. Its 32 different combinations barely fit enough symbols to be useful. While the Baudot code is obsolete, the word _baud_ is still with us, and it refers to the number of symbols per second in a communication channel.\n",
    "\n",
    "The code for this punched tape might rather be the Murray code, 1901, which modified the Baudot code to minimize the average numbers of holes punched given a typical message. \n",

    "Both these codes use a system of _shift_, where a shift character uses the reminaing 31 characters in either _letter_ or _figure_ contexts.

    "The SR Latch works as follows. It is found in the hold state ($R=S=0$) in either the $Q=0$ or $Q=1$ state. Because the $R$ and $S$ are zero, we have a loop in which $Q$ sets $Q'$ to its negation and $Q'$ sets $Q$ to its negation. So we have a stable stored value.\n",

In the quantum domain there is a wave function that can be manipulated but not directly seen. To get classical information from the wave function, it must be measured, and in doing so it collapses into one of a few classical states as determined by the measuring instrument.

If the qubit lies on the equator of the sphere, the qubit is in a perfect _superposition_ of the 0 and 1 state. When measured it will measure and collapse to 0 or 1 with even probability.\n"
